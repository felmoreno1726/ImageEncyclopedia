# ImageEncyclopedia
Mobile android app that takes an image as input and produces useful information to the user. The computer vision model is built implementing a novel architecture for mobile which combines SqueezeNet and MobileNets to achieve improvements in latency and reduction of memory usage.

Implemented a novel perception model which combines the SqueezeNet macro-architecture and the MobileNets micro-architecture to achieve low latency model and reduce memory usage. Then deployed the model on an Android image classifier app.
